Disclaimer: This project is meant as a demonstration to scrape data on Instagram using Selenium. Please use it responsibly. 

A bot which given a channel name as input, extracts for the first 200 followers in the channel the following stats:
1.Follower name
2. Number of posts
3. Number of followers
4. Number of people following 

This information is stored in a csv data follower_stats_{ChannelName}.csv. Using this csv data further data analysis can be made for example number of real followers, potential bots or fake followers etc.
If you use code please cite it or star the repo! 

Following is a demo for a random follower in natgeo channel:
