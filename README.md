# Insta-follower-stats-bot
Disclaimer: This project is meant as a demonstration to scrape data on Instagram using Selenium. Please use it responsibly. 

This project implements a bot which given an Instagram channel name as input, extracts for the first 200 followers in the channel the following stats:
1.Follower name
2. Number of posts
3. Number of followers
4. Number of people following 

This information is stored as a csv data in {date}_instaChannel.csv. Using this csv data further data analysis can be made for example number of real followers, potential bots or fake followers etc.
If you use code please cite it or star the repo!
